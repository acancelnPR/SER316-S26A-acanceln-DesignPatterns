# SER316-S26A-acanceln-DesignPatterns
In this multi-week assignment, you’ll design and implement a complex simulation using two different design patterns that work together in a cohesive system. This project emphasizes not just implementing patterns, but understanding when and why to use them, and how they interact in real-world applications.
